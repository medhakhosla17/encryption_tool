Encrypted Cloud Sync

Encrypted Cloud Sync is a Python-based solution for securely storing and sharing files in the cloud. It encrypts files locally using an integrated encryption API, ensuring sensitive data is protected before being uploaded or shared.

Features

API-Driven Encryption – Uses a secure encryption API to protect files locally before upload.

Local Decryption – Quickly restore encrypted files to their original form when needed.

Data Privacy by Design – Original and decrypted files are excluded from version control via .gitignore, preventing accidental uploads.

Lightweight & Easy – Simple Python scripts to run encryption and decryption without complex setup.

How It Works

Place your input files in the designated folder.

Run the encryption script to create encrypted versions using the API.

Upload or sync only the encrypted files to your cloud storage.

Use the decryption script to recover original files when required.
